Subject: [PATCH] Fix Chunk Loading

Fixed an oversight with loading surrounding chunks that caused entities to not load any chunks if the entity was travelling to the south or east.

+        This implementation is flawed, as it does not work properly in south and east directions.
+        The reason for this is because the motion would be negative in those directions which
+        would cause the checks to fail, as it is missing min and max checks.
+
+        Now you're going to be saying my cannon loaded chunks in those directions,
+        you are right about that, the reason it works is because theres an additional layer
+        of chunk loading, I personally believe this method is meant to ensure that the current position
+        is loaded as it isn't guaranteed that the entity will move at all.
+
+        This additional layer is located in the getCubes method, we can remove the excess logic from here
+        and take advantage of that with the triangle patch that was implemented in TacoSpigot
+        this allows for triangle chunk loading allowing to us to reduce chunks loaded by cannons.
